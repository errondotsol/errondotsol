<h2 align="center">👋 Hello Wordl</h2>

💻 I don’t really code — I just open VS Code, stare at the screen for an hour, and call it “debugging.”  
🪶 Most of my commits are just README edits and extra semicolons I add for moral support.  

⚙️ My workflow is 90% trial, 10% error, and somehow still 100% broken.  

🧠 I write code the same way people write tweets — impulsively, with no plan, and a vague hope it makes sense later.  
📜 My Git history looks like a cry for help written in commit messages.

🧰 **Tech stack:** Ctrl + Z, 🤖 AI, and blind optimism.  
🎯 **Goal:** make something that compiles before I lose interest.  

🔥 Just another day pretending to be a software engineer while the compiler prays for mercy.
