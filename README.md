## Hi there 👋

I don’t really code — I just open VS Code, stare at the screen for an hour, and call it “debugging.”
Most of my commits are just README edits and extra semicolons I add for moral support.
I live by the motto: “If it works, don’t ask why.”

My workflow is 90% trial, 10% error, and somehow still 100% broken.

I write code the same way people write tweets — impulsively, with no plan, and a vague hope it makes sense later.
My Git history looks like a cry for help written in commit messages.

Tech stack: Ctrl + Z, Stack Overflow, and blind optimism.
Goal: make something that compiles before I lose interest.

Just another day pretending to be a software engineer while the compiler prays for mercy.
